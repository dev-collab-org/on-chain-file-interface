# Steps to Add a Prototype Interface

- write a Solidity interface for getting file content from a smart contract
- add a .sol file with a new name to this [interfaces directory](./)  containing the solidity implementation of the interface.
- optionally add a note describing pros and cons of the interface to the [notes directory](../notes/).
- if there are publicly accessible clients for the interface (ie it is actually in use), add a markdown file with info about them to the [prototypes directory](../prototypes/).
