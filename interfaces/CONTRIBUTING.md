# Steps to Add a Prototype Interface

- write a Solidity interface for getting file content from a smart contract
- add a .sol file with a new name to the [interfaces](./interfaces/) directory containing the solidity implementation of the interface.
- optionally add a note describing pros and cons of the interface to the [notes](./notes/) directory.
- optionally add an example client of the interface to the [clients](./clients/) directory.
