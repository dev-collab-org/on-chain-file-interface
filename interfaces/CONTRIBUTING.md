# Steps to Add a Prototype Interface

- write a Solidity interface for getting file content from a smart contract
- add a .sol file with a new name to the [interfaces](./interfaces) directory containing the [solidity implementation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/contracts.html#interfaces) of your interface.
- optionally add a note describing pros and cons of the interface to the [notes](./notes) directory.
- optionally add an example client of the interface to the [prototypes](./prototypes) directory.
